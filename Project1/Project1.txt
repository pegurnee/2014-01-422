; uncomment following two lines if using 16f627 or 16f628. config uses internal oscillator
	LIST	p=16F628		;tell assembler what chip we are using
	include "P16F628.inc"		;include the defaults for the chip
	__config 0x3D18			;sets the configuration settings (oscillator type etc.)

; DECLARE VARIABLES!!!!!!
; We are telling the assembler we want to start allocating symbolic variables starting
;    at machine location 0x20. Please refer to technical documents to see if this is OK!!

cblock 	0x20 			;start of general purpose registers
		outLoop		;outLoop is symbolic name for location 0x20 - used in both subroutines for the outerloop
		midLoop		;
		inLoop 		;inLoop is symbolic name for location 0x21 - used in both subroutines for inner loops
