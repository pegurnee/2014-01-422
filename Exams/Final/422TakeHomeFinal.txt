1.
	9 bytes for full time/temp data:
		2 bytes for temp
		7 bytes for date and time
			-seconds
			-minutes
			-hours
			-day
			-date
			-month
			-year

2.
	PIC EEPROM = 128 bytes
	We would be able to store ~14.2222 ordered pairs of temp/times into the EEPROM.
	
3.
	4 pins from the pic
		2 pins for the thermometer (only communication, not parasite power)
			-while the thermometer only has one control line, the PIC chip needs
				and input and output line to communicate with it
			-we aren't using parasite power because of its inability to be
				used in temperatures over 100ÂºC, safety first
		2 pins for the clock
			-one for transmitting and one for receiving on the 2-wire serial bus
	
4.
	Initializing all of the code would come first.
	
	Every thirty minutes (established by a combination of timer interrupts and our 
		own post scaler) we would poll the thermometer and clock for data.
		
	That data would be stored in EEADR++ (in the current EEPROM address and then 
		increment the EEPROM address register)
		
	After we reach 8 storings, we would restart the EEADR to the beginning.

5.
	Bonuses of the one wire protocol include the fact that only one pin is being used by
		the object, instead of more than one with other protocols.
