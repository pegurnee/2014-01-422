; uncomment following two lines if using 16f627 or 16f628.
	LIST	p=16F628		;tell assembler what chip we are using
	include "P16F628.inc"	;include the defaults for the chip
	__config 0x3D18			;sets the configuration settings (oscillator type etc.)

; We are telling the assembler we want to start allocating symbolic variables starting
;    at machine location 0x20.

cblock 	0x20 			;start of general purpose registers
		var1			;var1 is symbolic name for location 0x20 - <use>
		var2 			;var2 is symbolic name for location 0x21 - <use>
	endc

;standard operation for using interrupts
	org 0x00
		goto	main
	org 0x04
		goto	isr

main

;the following lines turn off the comparators
			movlw	0x07
			movwf	CMCON			;turn comparators off (make it like a 16F84)
		
;enabled interrupts on B0
			bsf		INTCON, GIE		;enable interrupts
			bsf		INTCON,INTE		;B0 is the interrupt line
	
;We must change memory banks to set the TRIS registers
			bsf		STATUS,RP0
			movlw	b'00000001'
			movwf	TRISB			;PORTB is output, with RB0 as input (for the interrupt for later)
			movlw	b'00000110'
			movwf	TRISA			;PORTA is input, with RA1 and RA2 for output for the servos
