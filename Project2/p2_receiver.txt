; uncomment following two lines if using 16f627 or 16f628.
	LIST	p=16F628		;tell assembler what chip we are using
	include "P16F628.inc"	;include the defaults for the chip
	__config 0x3D18			;sets the configuration settings (oscillator type etc.)

; We are telling the assembler we want to start allocating symbolic variables starting
;    at machine location 0x20.

cblock 	0x20 			;start of general purpose registers
		var1			;var1 is symbolic name for location 0x20 - <use>
		var2 			;var2 is symbolic name for location 0x21 - <use>
	endc

;the following lines turn off the comparators
	movlw	0x07
	movwf	CMCON		;turn comparators off (make it like a 16F84)
	
;We must change memory banks to set the TRIS registers

	bsf		STATUS,RP0
	movlw	0x00
	movwf	TRISB			;PORTB is output
	movlw	0xff
	movwf	TRISA			;PORTA is input
	bcf		STATUS,RP0		;return to bank 0

;actual code follows here
	
	
				
;Subroutine: <name>
;<subroutine summary>
;Precondition: <requirements for the subroutine to execute correctly>
;Postcondition: <results after correct subroutine execution>
;<subroutine label>
;			return


; don't forget the word 'end' (it ends the code)
